## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Quick Test (Recommended)**
1. Start backend: `python backend/agents/worker_entrypoint.py`
2. Start frontend: `cd agent_ui && npm start`
3. Go to home page, click "🌐 Real-Time Translation"
4. Click "Create Test Room"
5. Click "Join as User A" (Spanish speaker)
6. In another browser/tab, click "Join as User B" (English speaker)
7. Start speaking - translation happens automatically!

### **Custom Translation Room**
1. Click "🌐 Real-Time Translation" on home page
2. Fill in custom user identities and languages
3. Click "Create Translation Room"

## 🔄 **System Flow**

### **Translation Room Creation**
1. Frontend calls `/api/realtime-translation/rooms/create`
2. Backend creates specialized 2-user room
3. Pre-generates optimized tokens for both users
4. Configures real-time translation metadata
5. Returns connection info for both users

### **User Connection**
1. User clicks join button with pre-generated token
2. Frontend stores connection data in sessionStorage
3. RoomPage detects translation mode
4. Connects using pre-generated token (no additional API calls)
5. Real-time translation agent automatically starts

### **Translation Flow**
1. User A speaks Spanish
2. FastSTT processes with 500ms max delay
3. RealTimeTranslationBuffer queues for translation
4. Translation service translates Spanish → English
5. CleanAudioRouter ensures User B only hears English translation
6. User A hears nothing (their own speech is not routed back)
7. Reverse flow for User B speaking English
